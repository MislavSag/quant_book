# Quantconnect backtesting engine (#sec-qc)




### Execution Sequence

As stateed in the official Quantconnect documentation, the algorithm manager calls events in the following order:

1. Scheduled Events.
2. Consolidation event handlers 
3. on_data event handler.

## TODO: Citation starts here
This event flow is important to note. For instance, if your consolidation handlers or on_data event handler appends data to a RollingWindow and you use that RollingWindow in your Scheduled Event, when the Scheduled Event executes, the RollingWindow won't contain the most recent data.

The consolidators are called in the order that they are updated. If you register them for automatic updates, they are updated in the order that you register them.
